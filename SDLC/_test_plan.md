- Regression Testing
- Security Testing
- **Browser Testing**  
  This will involve verifying the functionality and usability of the webshop across different web browsers and devices.

### Risks and Issues
- **Risk 1:** Potential delays in feature delivery.  
  **Mitigation:** Implement a buffer in the schedule.  
- **Risk 2:** Browser compatibility issues.  
  **Mitigation:** Conduct early and regular browser testing during development.  
- **Risk 3:** Inadequate test coverage due to tight deadlines.  
  **Mitigation:** Prioritize test cases based on risk and impact.  
- **Risk 4:** Payment system failures, services outage.  
  **Mitigation:** Perform thorough integration testing with payment gateways and ensure fallback mechanisms are in place.  
- **Risk 5:** User acceptance delays.  
  **Mitigation:** Engage stakeholders early and conduct frequent demos to ensure alignment.
